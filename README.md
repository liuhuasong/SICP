## Solutions to SICP exercises

[In Progress...]

Solutions to exercises of The Wizard Book: Structure and Interpretation of Computer 
Programs (SICP), by Herold Abelson and Gerald Sussman, 2nd Edition, MIT Press.

Note:

  * Section 2.2.4 (the picture language exercise; ex-2.44-to-ex-2.52-a-picture-language.rkt)
     is written in _Racket_ (formerly PLT Scheme). It requires [sicp.plt](http://planet.racket-lang.org/display.ss?package=sicp.plt&owner=soegaard) package from PLaneT for the primitive operations of the picture language.
     Run the programs in DrRacket for the images to display correctly.

  * All other programs are written using _MIT/GNU Scheme 9.1.1._


SICP is a classic, must-read book for every passionate programmer. Some interesting 
reads about SICP:

  * _Peter Norvig_, Director of Research at Google, reasons out the split between those
  who love and those who hate SICP - http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8.

  * _Joel Spolsky_ explains the importance of understanding SICP and the repercussions
  of JavaSchools on the quality of programmers -

The book is available online at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html.

SICP video lectures by Abelson and Sussman themselves (given to HP employees in 1986)
can be found at http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.001/abelson-sussman-lectures/.


This project is a part of my Functional Programming journey. I had just finished
"The Little Schemer" (and had placed an order for "The Seasoned Schemer" :) ) when
I started SICP. The Little Schemer takes you quickly from the basics of Scheme 
to deriving the applicative-order Y Combinator and writing a simple meta-circular 
interpreter in just 10 chapters. Scheme code snippets from The Little Schemer can
be found at https://github.com/viswanathgs/The-Little-Schemer.
