Solutions to exercises of The Wizard Book: Structure and Interpretation of Computer 
Programs (SICP), by Herold Abelson and Gerald Sussman, 2nd Edition, MIT Press.

The book is available online at http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html.

All programs are written using MIT/GNU Scheme 9.1.1.

SICP is a classic, must-read book for every passionate programmer. Some interesting 
reads about SICP:

  Peter Norvig, Director of Research at Google, reasons out the split between those
  who love and those who hate SICP - http://www.amazon.com/review/R403HR4VL71K8.

  Joel Spolsky explains the importance of understanding SICP and the repercussions
  of JavaSchools on the quality of programmers -

This project is a part of my Functional Programming journey. I had just finished
"The Little Schemer" (and had placed an order for "The Seasoned Schemer" :) ) when
I started SICP. The Little Schemer takes you quickly from the basics of Scheme 
to deriving the applicative-order Y Combinator and writing a simple meta-circular 
interpreter in just 10 chapters. Scheme code snippets from The Little Schemer can
be found at https://github.com/viswanathgs/The-Little-Schemer.
